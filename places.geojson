As the crowd surged down the narrow staircase, a number of children fell and were trampled or were crushed by other children. Other children, under pressure from the crowd behind them, had to climb or walk over the fallen children to escape danger. Even children who had not originally joined the stampede became panicked because of the screams of those on the stairs.",

There are also suspicions that several other ordinances of the municipality were not fulfilled. Also, questions were asked whether the checks had been carried out sufficiently by the municipality. Following the event, as result of the inquiry, the Mayor of Edam-Volendam Frank IJsselmuiden and the alderman Wim Visscher resigned from their positions.",

The materials used in the building for decoration were flammable: mostly wood, styrofoam, acoustic panels and a plastic net (media sombra). This plastic net was hung from the ceiling and caught fire first, melting into a rain of fire. In some parts of the building, teddy bear stuffing was used as a cheap alternative to wool fiber. The owner and the band's lead singer had told the patrons not to use flares inside the building.  Four of the six doors, some of which were fire exits, were chained shut so that 'people would not enter without paying', according to Mayor Aníbal Ibarra. 'Most of the victims died from inhaling poisonous gases, and carbon monoxide.'",

Witness accounts suggest that events were initiated after a rain shelter collapsed, which worshipers mistakenly took to be a landslide. There were as many as 3000 devotees at the temple because it was a sacred place (called a 'Shakti Peeth') in the holy month of Shraavana of the Hindu Calendar.  According to Daljit Singh Manhas, a senior police officer from the area, at least 40 of the victims were children.",
        "Cause": "Devotees standing in a queue initially saw the collapse of a rain shelter. This triggered a false cry of 'landslide!' as it was raining on the day of the stampede.[2] People reportedly tried to move outside the railings put up by the police for crowd control, but the police refused to allow any more movements. The railings later collapsed and people fell on each other, starting the stampede.",
